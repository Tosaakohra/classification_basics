In this class we will go through basic process of classification in python. During the lectures we will work with the HR case study dataset published on the kaggle website. We will try to predict whether given employee will leave the company in the near future or not. For the predictions we will compare the performance of algorithms of K-nearest neighbor classifier (KNN) and Logistic regression. 

This tutorial is dedicated for machine learning beginners who are ready to learn practical basics. For each phase of the machine learning process we will go through example code in Python. For the most of the algorithms we will use scikit-learn library. 

This tutorial is not a mathematical nor statistical lecture filled with formal proves and equations. I don't recommend this tutorial to absolute python beginners. For those I recommend my previous courses in road to machine learning par 1,2 and 3.

This course will cover following topics:

Machine learning introduction 
- Dataset introduction
- Exploratory analysis
- First prediction 
- Numerical preprocessing 
- Categorical preprocessing
- Final preprocessing 
- Algorithm explanation
- Feature selection
- Grid search 
- Scikit-learn pipelines

After this course you will get familiar with terms: 
- Scaling
- Normalization
- Encoding (one hot encoding)
- Histogram 
- Scatter plot
- Train and test set
- Cross validation
- Precision, recall and F1 score
- Hyper parameters
